# Disaster-Prediction
## About
Our solution directly addresses the need for improving the predictability of natural disasters by providing early
warning to local communities, governments and emergency responders providing sufficient time for evacuation (if
necessary) and disaster preparedness. This platform for the management of disaster-related crises utilizes artificial intelligence, satellite technology, and
alert systems for addressing disaster risks in a comprehensive manner.
## Instructions for setting up and running the code
- Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or later).
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
- pip install requests pillow matplotlib opencv-python-headless numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn
- For running the code in Google Colab, no installation is needed; most libraries are pre-installed.
### Steps to Run the Project:
- Open Your Python Environment:
Use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any Python IDE like PyCharm or VSCode.

- Upload or Place the Dataset:

- If using Google Colab:
Upload the flood.csv file by uncommenting and running the files.upload() line in the code.
If running locally:
Place the flood.csv file in the specified directory. Update the file path in the script if needed.
